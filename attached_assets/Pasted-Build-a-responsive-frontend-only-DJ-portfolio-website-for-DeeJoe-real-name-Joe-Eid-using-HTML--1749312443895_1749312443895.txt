Build a responsive frontend-only DJ portfolio website for "DeeJoe" (real name: Joe Eid), using HTML, CSS (Tailwind or custom CSS), and JavaScript (if needed). The website must be optimized for mobile users (phone screens first), fully responsive, and designed with a dark modern theme — use colors like dark gray, black, electric blue, or neon accents.

The site should include:

🏠 Home / Hero Section:
DJ name “DeeJoe” in bold.

Tagline: “Bringing Life to Every Beat.”

Background with an image or a blurred video loop (optional).

A “Book Me” button linking to WhatsApp or email.

🧑‍🎤 About Me Section:
